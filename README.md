# SpringMailAPI

Integrating with Sendgrid
To integrate with SendGrids SMTP API:

Create an API Key with at least “Mail” permissions.
Set the server host in your email client or application to smtp.sendgrid.net.
This setting is sometimes referred to as the external SMTP server or the SMTP relay.
Set your username to apikey.
Set your password to the API key generated in step 1.
Set the port to 587.
Now that you’ve integrated, learn to build SMTP email.
